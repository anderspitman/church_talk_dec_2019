# Introduction (2 min)

* "My brothers and sisters, it is now my assignment to speak to you, and your
  assignment is to listen. My goal is to finish my assignment before you finish
  yours."

* Bishopric learned their mistake and had me speak the week after Christmas
  instead of the week before Christmas this year.

* 2 Nephi 28:30 - Line upon line

* I'm not really going to talk much about specifics. More about principles I've
  found to be useful when thinking about these things.


# What sorts of progression did Christ experience? (5 min)

* Surprisingly hard question to answer.

* What did Jesus do?
  * Got baptized (Matt 3)
  * Fasted (Matt 4)
  * Suffered physically (Matt 4)
  * Suffered temptations (Matt 4)
  * Grew and progressed in wisdom (Luke 2)
  * Thou art my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased (Luke 3:22)
  * Heb 5:8 - Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things
    which he suffered;

* Heb 4:5 - For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the
  feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet
  without sin.

* The BoM and D&C actually give us quite a bit of our knowledge.

## D&C 93

> 11 And I, John, bear record that I beheld his glory, as the glory of the Only
> Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth, even the Spirit of truth,
> which came and dwelt in the flesh, and dwelt among us.
> 
> 12 And I, John, saw that he received not of the fulness at the first, but
> received grace for grace;
> 
> 13 And he received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace to
> grace, until he received a fulness;
> 
> 14 And thus he was called the Son of God, because he received not of the
> fulness at the first.
> 
> 15 And I, John, bear record, and lo, the heavens were opened, and the Holy
> Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove, and sat upon him, and there
> came a voice out of heaven saying: This is my beloved Son.
> 
> 16 And I, John, bear record that he received a fulness of the glory of the
> Father;
> 
> 17 And he received all power, both in heaven and on earth, and the glory of
> the Father was with him, for he dwelt in him.
>
> ...
>
> 20 For if you keep my commandments you shall receive of his fulness, and be
> glorified in me as I am in the Father; therefore, I say unto you, you shall
> receive grace for grace.

I think it's really interesting that this is connected with the Savior's
baptism.

## 2 Nephi 31

> 5 And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be baptized
> by water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we,
> being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by water!
> 
> 6 And now, I would ask of you, my beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb of God
> did fulfil all righteousness in being baptized by water?
> 
> 7 Know ye not that he was holy? But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth
> unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself
> before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient
> unto him in keeping his commandments.
> 
> 8 Wherefore, after he was baptized with water the Holy Ghost descended upon
> him in the form of a dove.
> 
> 9 And again, it showeth unto the children of men the straitness of the path,
> and the narrowness of the gate, by which they should enter, he having set the
> example before them.
> 
> 10 And he said unto the children of men: Follow thou me. Wherefore, my
> beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the
> commandments of the Father?


# Measuring (5 min)

* In engineering, order to improve something, you must first measure it.
  * This can be harder than it sounds with spiritual matters
  * Junior engineers often can't see beyond the immediate problem, and seek to
    address it by attacking the symptons, when there are actually deeper issues
    that must be resolved.
  * So how do we make sure we're measuring the right things?

* The #1 metric is how you spend your time. Time is the raw material of
  accomplishment.
  * The simplest way to improve at something is to spend more time on it.
  * You can also improve the quality of the time.
  * How did the Savior spend his time?
    * Teaching
    * Miracles
    * With those not considered to be "faithful"
    * You're the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.
      * You might think Jesus would be a great fisherman but that's about it.
  * We talk a lot about the pride cycle in the Book of Mormon, but at the end
    of the day what were the actual signs?
    * Neglecting the poor and needy
    * Focus on money and stuff
    * Lack of faith in Christ


# Improving (3 min)

## Elder Ballard - Apr 2017 - goals

> Over the years, I have observed that those who accomplish the most in this
> world are those with a vision for their lives, with goals to keep them focused
> on their vision and tactical plans for how to achieve them. Knowing where you
> are going and how you expect to get there can bring meaning, purpose, and
> accomplishment to life.
> 
> Some have difficulty differentiating between a goal and a plan until they learn
> that a goal is a destination or an end, while a plan is the route by which you
> get there. For example, we can have a goal to drive to a certain unfamiliar
> location, and as some of you dear sisters know, we men often think we know how
> to get there -- often resulting in our saying, “I know it must be just
> around the next corner.” My wife must be smiling. The goal was clear, but there
> wasn’t a good plan in place to reach the destination.
> 
> Goal setting is essentially beginning with the end in mind. And planning is
> devising a way to get to that end. A key to happiness lies in understanding
> what destinations truly matter -- and then spending our time, effort, and
> attention on the things that constitute a sure way to arrive there.

I would also like to add habits. I've become convinced that the key to
accomplishing great things is goals, and the key to accomplishing goals is
habits.

# Conclusion (2 min)

## Elder Klebingat Oct 2014 Conference
> While presiding over the Ukraine Kyiv Mission, I once asked one of my most
> faithful sisters why she was always so hard on herself, why she was always
> beating herself up over the smallest things. Her answer was a classic example
> of someone listening to the wrong voice as she replied, "So no one can beat me
> to it."
> 
> Brothers and sisters, my counsel to this sister missionary is my counsel to
> you: Acknowledge and face your weaknesses, but don't be immobilized by them,
> because some of them will be your companions until you depart this earth life.

  * That's somehow both obvious and disappointing.
* Testimony


# Brainstorm

* 2 Nephi 9:28-29 - When they are learned they think they are wise
* Contrast between social/cultural norms and what the doctrine actually says:
  * If we spotted bishop having a sip of whiskey, it would be the talk of the
    ward for a month, but doctrinally speaking I've never seen anything that
    claims that's worse than having a steak. The Word of Wisdom is clear on
    both counts.
  * I'm not advocating drinking whiskey. Clearly brandy would be a better
    choice. I'm advocating being thoughtful about your obedience, not with the
    intent of getting away with more, but with the intent of understanding the
    mind of God a little bit more and showing your love through thoughtful
    obedience.
* Goals
  * Any successful app or software service is basically a function of how
    well the engineers were able to break a large problem into smaller problems
    that could be solved separately then combined together. Your brain can
    only process about 4-7 things at a time.
  * Goals, plans, and habits
